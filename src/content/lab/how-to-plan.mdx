# “Small, Clear, Practical” — How to Manage Projects

## 1. Break Features into Smaller Sprints (≈ 3 Months)

- Instead of aiming for a massive release all at once, I want to break work into manageable sprints.  
- **Example:** Q1 focuses on refactoring and redesigning the UI → Q2 on backend API optimization and database tuning.  
- Smaller chunks mean fewer merge conflicts, faster feedback, and a steady flow of deploys.

## 2. Track Only 2–3 Key Metrics

- I plan to focus on the most critical performance and product metrics, not every possible data point.  
- **Example:** “Monthly active users” and “average response time” from the API.  
- This prevents dashboard overload and keeps the team focused on what really impacts the user.

## 3. Tackle Low-Resistance Tasks First

- Start with quick wins that get stakeholders (or the team) saying “yes” fast.  
- **Example:** Improving Lighthouse scores by tweaking image formats, or adjusting a color contrast for accessibility.  
- Small commits that merge easily can boost morale before tackling the heavier PRs.

## 4. Review & Retrospect Every Quarter

- I’ll make it a habit to run a quarterly retrospective: What shipped? What got blocked?  
- **Example:** If switching to lazy loading reduced Time to Interactive by 20%, it goes into the standard dev checklist.  
- Keeping a changelog or internal dev blog will help us track progress and decisions over time.

> 💡 **Dev Note:**  
> By treating goals like sprints, limiting noise in the metrics, and building momentum with small merges, I hope to keep projects shipping smoothly while still aiming for the big architectural wins.
