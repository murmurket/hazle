# Sorting Algorithms & Mathematical Concepts

A quick review of essential sorting and searching algorithms, as well as exponential and logarithmic growth — for Week 3 of CS50.

## Searching

### Linear Search
- Check every element one by one.
- Time complexity: O(n)

### Binary Search
- Requires the array to be sorted first.
- Repeated searches are faster: O(log n).
- Ideal when the same data will be searched many times.

## Merge Sort Example

Input: [8, 3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 1, 2]  
1. Split → [8, 3, 5, 4] and [7, 6, 1, 2]  
2. Split again → until single elements  
3. Merge sorted halves:  
   - [3, 8] and [4, 5] → [3, 4, 5, 8]  
   - [6, 7] and [1, 2] → [1, 2, 6, 7]  
4. Final merge → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

## Selection Sort Example

Input: [(2, 'A'), (1, 'X'), (2, 'B')]  
1. Find the min: (1, 'X') → swap with (2, 'A')  
   → [(1, 'X'), (2, 'A'), (2, 'B')]  
2. Find the next min: (2, 'A') or (2, 'B')  
   - If comparing with `<` only, the earlier stays.  
   - If using `<=`, the later might be selected → unstable.

```python
if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
    min_idx = j
