Sorting Algorithms & Mathematical Concepts

A quick review of essential sorting and searching algorithms, as well as exponential and logarithmic growth — for Week 3 of CS50.

## Searching

### 1. Linear Search
- Check every element one by one.
- Time complexity: O(n)

### 2. Binary Search
- Requires the array to be sorted first.
- Repeated searches are faster: O(log n).
- Ideal when the same data will be searched many times.

##Merge Sort Example

Input: [8, 3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 1, 2]
	1.	Split → [8, 3, 5, 4] and [7, 6, 1, 2]
	2.	Split again → until single elements
	3.	Merge sorted halves:
	•	[3, 8] and [4, 5] → [3, 4, 5, 8]
	•	[6, 7] and [1, 2] → [1, 2, 6, 7]
	4.	Final merge → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

⸻

##Selection Sort Example

Input: [(2, 'A'), (1, 'X'), (2, 'B')]
	1.	Find the min: (1, 'X') → swap with (2, 'A')
→ [(1, 'X'), (2, 'A'), (2, 'B')]
	2.	Find the next min: (2, 'A') or (2, 'B')
  ```text
	•	If comparing with < only, the earlier stays.
	•	If using <=, the later might be selected, changing order → unstable.
  ```

```python
    if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
    min_idx = j
```

### 🧠 Struct vs Class: Memory Allocation Differences

Although `struct` and `class` may look similar, they differ significantly in how they handle memory and copying.

#### 🧪 Code Example

```csharp
struct PointStruct {
    public int x, y;
}

class PointClass {
    public int x, y;
}

PointStruct a = new PointStruct { x = 1, y = 2 };
PointStruct b = a;  // Value copy → independent

PointClass c = new PointClass { x = 1, y = 2 };
PointClass d = c;  // Reference copy → shared
