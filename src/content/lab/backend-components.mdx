# Backend, from the Ground Up

This post demonstrates the **3 essential components of backend development**  
presented in Lab's MDX rendering style, including quotes, lists, checklists, tables, and code blocks.

---

## 1. Web Server – Serving Static Files

The web began as a way to share static documents across the globe.

- A **web server** (like Nginx or Apache) simply sends `.html`, `.css`, or `.js` files to browsers.
- Everyone sees the same page. There’s no user-specific content.
- No logic, no thinking—just serving.

> Think of it as a super-optimized "file fetcher."

---

## 2. WAS (Web Application Server) – Handling Logic & Dynamic Content

As demand grew for dynamic features—guestbooks, logins, personalized views—**Web Servers fell short**.

That’s where **WAS** comes in:

- It receives a request, **executes code**, and returns dynamic results.
- It's the **runtime** that runs backend logic.
- WAS interprets requests, connects to databases, and returns generated content.

### Common Misconception

People often confuse **WAS** with **Backend Frameworks** (e.g., Django, Spring, Express). Here's the difference:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>WAS</th>
      <th style="text-align: right;">Backend Framework</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Executes your code</td>
      <td style="text-align: right;">Provides structure &amp; tools for code</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Like a car engine</td>
      <td style="text-align: right;">Like the blueprint to build the car</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>E.g., Tomcat, Node.js</td>
      <td style="text-align: right;">E.g., Django, Express, Spring</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> Even Spring Boot or Express includes an embedded WAS like Tomcat or Node.js.

## 3. Database – Storing & Protecting Data

WAS can calculate, but it **cannot remember**.

- Once the server restarts, all data is gone… unless you use a **Database**.
- Databases are designed for:
  - **Concurrency**: handling multiple users at once
  - **Integrity**: e.g., transferring money between accounts safely
  - **Search Speed**: indexes let you find what you need instantly

**Why not just use a text file?**

Because plain files:
- Can't prevent race conditions
- Can’t guarantee "all-or-nothing" operations
- Are slow to search

> A **Database** is a battle-tested solution to real-world data problems.

## How They Work Together (Example)

### 1. First Visit (Static Page Load)
- Browser requests a site → **Web Server** sends HTML, JS
- Page appears

### 2. Login (Dynamic Processing)
- User submits login → Web Server proxies to **WAS**
- WAS checks credentials in **Database**
- If valid, returns token (JWT) → user is logged in

### 3. Viewing Posts
- Browser requests `/api/post/123`
- WAS checks token, fetches from DB, returns JSON
- Frontend renders post data

## Why This Matters

The history of backend architecture is the story of solving real limitations:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Problem</th>
      <th style={{textAlign: "right"}}>Solution</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>How to share static documents</td>
      <td style={{textAlign: "right"}}>Web Server</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>How to respond to dynamic requests</td>
      <td style={{textAlign: "right"}}>WAS</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>How to store data safely & fast</td>
      <td style={{textAlign: "right"}}>Database</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Together, they embody **Separation of Concerns**—the core principle behind scalable systems.

## Final Thoughts

By deeply understanding these 3 components:

- You'll finally grasp what "backend" really means.
- You’ll have a mental model that makes tools like Kubernetes or Redis make actual sense.
- And you'll ace backend interviews with confidence—not memorization.
