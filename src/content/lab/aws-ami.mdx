This post explains the **three key layers of a server environment** â€” OS, Application Server, and Software/Middleware.  
Think of it as the skeleton, the office layout, and the furniture/tools inside the office.

## 1. Operating System (OS)

The **foundation of a computer system**.  
It manages hardware resources and provides the environment where applications can run.

- **Examples**
  - **Linux family**: Amazon Linux (AWS optimized), Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, SUSE  
  - **Windows family**: Windows Server 2019 / 2022  
  - **Other**: macOS (special case on EC2 `mac1` instances)

- **Roles**
  - Manage hardware (CPU, memory, disk)  
  - User permission and access control  
  - Provide basic networking  
  - Base layer for running software

## 2. Application Server

The **middle layer that processes user requests**.  
It runs on top of the OS and serves web applications or APIs.

- **Examples**
  - **Web Application Servers (WAS)**: Apache Tomcat (Java), WildFly/JBoss (Java EE), WebLogic, WebSphere  
  - **Web servers often overlapping**: Nginx, Apache HTTP Server, IIS (Windows)

- **Roles**
  - Handle client requests (HTTP/HTTPS)  
  - Generate dynamic pages (JSP, PHP, Flask, Node.js, etc.)  
  - Load balancing & session management  
  - Expose APIs and execute business logic  

---

## 3. Software / Middleware & Tools

Various tools, libraries, and runtimes that run **on or between the OS and application server**.  
Includes databases, monitoring agents, runtimes, and developer tools.

- **Examples**
  - **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, Redis  
  - **Runtime environments**: Java (JDK), Python, Node.js, .NET  
  - **Containers/Virtualization**: Docker, Kubernetes agents  
  - **Security & management tools**: Fail2Ban, iptables, CloudWatch Agent  
  - **Dev tools & packages**: Git, Maven, Gradle, npm  

- **Roles**
  - Data storage & processing  
  - Support application execution  
  - Strengthen system management & security  
  - Enable performance monitoring

## ðŸ‘‰ Easy Analogy

- **OS** = The **building skeleton**  
- **Application Server** = The **office layout inside the building**  
- **Software** = The **furniture and tools placed in the office**
