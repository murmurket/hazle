};

One of the earliest “aha!” moments I had in CS50 was with the `void` keyword in C.  
Before CS50, I’d written plenty of code in PHP, Ruby, JavaScript… but I’d never really *declared* that a function doesn’t return anything.  
When C made me write `void` right there in the function definition, it felt almost ceremonial — like making a promise to the compiler.

> “Learning `void` in C was the first time I felt the compiler saying, ‘I trust you… but I’ll verify.’”

## Static vs Dynamic Typed Languages

### Static Typing
- You declare types upfront.
- `void` is a formal contract.
- The compiler acts like a strict teacher: you can’t hand in something you didn’t promise.
- **My takeaway**: Clear and predictable, but more ceremony when you just want to get ideas out quickly.

**Examples**: C, C++, Java, C#, PHP (7.1+ with `: void`)

### Dynamic Typing
- Types are decided as the program runs.
- No `void` keyword. Functions can return nothing, or suddenly start returning something later.
- The language trusts you — but that trust can backfire.
- **My takeaway**: Fast to prototype, but you need self-discipline to keep things consistent.

**Examples**: Python, Ruby, JavaScript
